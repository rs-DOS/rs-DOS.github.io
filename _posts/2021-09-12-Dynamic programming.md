#Dynamic programming
Dynamic programming is widely-used technique for solving optimization problems. It was developed by [Richard Bellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bellman) while he was at RAND corporation. There's a fun anecdote on where the term *dynamic programming* comes from. At RAND Bellman was working on mathematical research and had a boss who had a ["pathological fear and hatred of the word "research""](https://web.archive.org/web/20050110161049/http://www.wu-wien.ac.at/usr/h99c/h9951826/bellman_dynprog.pdf). So protect his research from bureaucratic meddling he coined the term *dynamic programming*. At that time programming referred to mathematical programming (like linear programming) rather than computer programming <br>
Dynamic programming is way to go through all the possible points in a graph but in an intelligent manner. It is based on the *principle of optimality*. We break the problem into sub-problems, solve the sub-problems and put the sub-problems together to solve the original problem.
