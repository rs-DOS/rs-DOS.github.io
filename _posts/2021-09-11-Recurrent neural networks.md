#Recurrent Neural Networks

Recurrent neural networks are used where the data is sequence dependent. Understanding language, both audio and text, requires that the data be processed sequentially. Rewinding a audio or video clip of someone talking results in garbage. 

The difference between recurrent neural networks and plain neural networks is in how the information is processed. The output of a neural network in a RNN is a function of the input and the past memory of the cell state.
