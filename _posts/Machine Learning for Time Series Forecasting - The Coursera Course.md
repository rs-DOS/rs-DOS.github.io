#Machine Learning for Time Series Forecasting - The Coursera CourseThe first week covers the basics for time series forecasting like what is a na√Øve forecast, what is a moving average forecast and how to calculate the forecast accuracy.The second week we started with using machine learning for forecasting. One thing I initially did not understand was why was the data being shuffled. We would use windowed datasets with the a series of observations being the feature for the next observation which was a label. Shuffling the dataset around could meant turning the time series into a time hodgepodge. What is the benefit of that I could not see.	The answer is sequence bias.Sequence bias is when the order of things can impact the selection of things. When training data in a dataset, we don't want the sequence to impact the training so we shuffle the data up.  I don't think this argument is relevant to time series data as the preceding time points maybe exactly why a particular time point occurred. Removing the sequence will remove the order of things. A time series is not the same as a ranked list of preferences.Why do we
