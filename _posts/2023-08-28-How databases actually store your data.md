As a part of my effort to learn more about computers, I have started learning about databases. For a former analyst like me SQL should have been my bread and butter, alas companies still prefer Excel. In current organization, our database system is a little different and to understand that system better, I have decided that I must be able to compare it with industry standard systems to glean their differences. <br>

CMU has a great course for [introduction to databases](https://youtu.be/uikbtpVZS2s?si=ZvRwPnoFAigeuV_r) and the [Database System Concepts](https://www.db-book.com/) book by Silberschatz, Korth and Sudarshan is a very beginner friendly guide. <br>

### Starting with relations
Databases in the current form, that we all know and love so much, are based on mathematical theory known as relational algebra. It is hard for us to imagine a different way to store data other than the relational model. It is like an idea so simple that it's hard to imagine that we didn't come up with it sooner. <br>
The origins of the relational databases lie in a [paper by Edgar F. Codd](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~david/cs848s14/codd-relational.pdf).
