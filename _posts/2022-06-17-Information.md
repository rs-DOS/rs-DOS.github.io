### Notes from a course on information theory 
Information is simply the data received about a fact that resolves uncertainty. 
<br>Information theory as a field was created by Claude Shannon's work, [A Mathematical Theory of Communication](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf).
I think his treatise is the first to look information mathematically. Shannon was interested in reducing the communication losses
in transmission over phone lines. So a lot of textbooks use examples of transmission of text messages across phone lines. <br>
Information theory is also closely related to probability
