I have got some free time on my hand and operating systems sounds like an interesting thing to read up on. I picked [OPERATING SYSTEM CONCEPTS by SILBERSCHATZ, GALVIN and GAGNE](https://www.os-book.com/OS9/) because someone on Twitter recommended it.

### Chapter 3 Processes
A process is the unit of work in a modern time-sharing system. Informally, a process is a program in execution. <br>
A process is an active entity where as a program is an passive entity. A program becomes a process when an executable file is loaded into memory.<br>
A process usually includes: 
<li> program code - text section
<li> program counter  - includes the current activity
<li> process stack - contains temporary data (such as function parameters, return addresses and local variables)
<li> data section - contains global variables
 <li> heap - memeory dynamicall allocated during process runtime
