### These are my notes as I read through the [Foundations of reinforcement learning book](https://github.com/TikhonJelvis/RL-book) by [Aswhin Rao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashwin2rao/) and 
[Tikhon Jelvis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tikhon-jelvis/).

## Chapter 1
The first chapter basically about coding and designing programs. The book has code samples (written in python) within it with explanations of the concepts relevant to RL.
All the code used in the book is available on the GitHub page. 

## Chapter 2
Defines basic concepts of sequential decision making. <br>
Markov states - they have the property that the probabilities of state *S<sub>t + 1</sub>* only depends on the current state *S<sub>t</sub>*
