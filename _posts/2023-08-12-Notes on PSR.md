There has been a lot of focus on performance at work so I am doing a deep dive on PSR testing. <br>

PSR stands for Performance, Scalability and Reliability. 
<br>

### Reliability
Reliability is about measuring how quickly the application comes back to its stable condition after a certain failure. Will my product bounce back after failure? How deep were my losses? 

#### Hardware Reliability
Measurement of how stable and reliable the system is after failure. This is more along lines of the failure
of the load balancer and it being replaced by another node and what errors are triggered because of this.
#### Software Reliability

#### Operator Reliability
When there is an interdependency between multiple products and what happens when one of them fails.

#### System Resiliency
It is about understanding the absorption of the impact failures i.e what is the depth of measurement of failures that occur in the system.
