### My notes on symmetry in scheduling problems

As the size of the problem set increases it generally becomes harder and harder to find optimal solutions oe even feasible solutions. One way to deal with this is to introduce symmetry breaking constraints. If we look at scheduling problems, what we are essentially doing is assigning tasks to machines and esnuring that constraints are met. In constraint programming lingo the start and end time for the task would be variables and the domain of the variables would be all possible values for the variables. <br>
