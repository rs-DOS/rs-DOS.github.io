Hi. My name is Rushabh Doshi. I work as a supply chain analyst within the Strategy and Analytics Cell at Intas Pharmaceuticals. This blog is about my interest in optimization algorithms and how they are used to solve practical business problems. There will be bits and pieces of materials science and machine learning thrown in as well.
